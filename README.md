# SQL


SQL
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the language we most often use to interact with databases. SQL is incredibly effective at manipulating data and is one of the easier languages to learn.

PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a flexible open-source object-relational database. and a database management system. It utilizes SQL as its primary language, and hence the name.

Relational Database
A relational database is best described as a digital representation of a relational model of data i.e. how information is linked together.
The database stores the organized table into tables (or relations). In the table, you can find different columns corresponding to the fields (attribute) of data, and rows corresponding to the different records (tuples).
